## Contribution Guidelines
* Minor changes can be done directly by editing code on github. Github automatically creates a temporary branch and
  files a PR. This is only suitable for really small changes like: spelling fixes, variable name changes or error string
  change etc. For larger commits, following steps are recommended.
* (Optional) If you want to discuss your implementation with the users of Gofr, use the github discussions of this repo.
* Configure your editor to use goimport and golangci-lint on file changes. Any code which is not formatted using these
  tools, will fail on the pipeline.
* All code contributions should have associated tests and all new line additions should be covered in those testcases.
  No PR should ever decrease the overall code coverage.
* Once your code changes are done along with the testcases, submit a PR to development branch. Please note that all PRs
  are merged from feature branches to development first.
* All PRs need to be reviewed by at least 2 Gofr developers. They might reach out to you for any clarfication.
* Thank you for your contribution. :)

### GoFr Testing Policy:

Testing is a crucial aspect of software development, and adherence to these guidelines ensures the stability, reliability, and maintainability of the GoFr codebase.

### Guidelines

1.  **Test Types:**

    -   Write unit tests for every new function or method.
    -   Include integration tests for any major feature added.


2. **Test Coverage:**

-   No new code should decrease the existing code coverage for the packages and files.
> The `code-climate` coverage check will not pass if there is any decrease in the test-coverage before and after any new PR is submitted.



3. **Naming Conventions:**

-   Prefix unit test functions with `Test`.
-   Use clear and descriptive names.
```go
func TestFunctionName(t *testing.T) { 
// Test logic 
}
```

## **Pull Request Process ðŸš€**

1. Ensure that you have self reviewed your code ðŸ˜€
2. Make sure you have added the proper description for the functionality of the code
3. I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas.
4. Add screenshot it help in review.
5. Submit your PR by giving the necesarry information in PR template and hang tight we will review it really soon ðŸš€
